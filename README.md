# Platzi Challenge - Food Delivery Service App

## The Task
For the next 3 weeks, you'll be creating your very own food delivery application, using the FoodMe open source application.
This application has been around for a long time, and looks like it needs some updates. Using your tech skills, you're going to be able to modernize this application and make it your ideal food delivery service app.

Haven't used a food delivery application before? Some examples include Rappi and UberEats if you'd like to get some ideas for design and features.

Remember: This challenge is meant for developers of all levels, and some of the functionality has been built in to give you a great start. Use the documentation from Angular, Bootstrap, Node, and your favorite resources on HTML, CSS, JavaScript to help you.

## Requirements
- The application must have one restaurant that features food from your country.
- The application must have some design changes from the original application (colors, font, photos for example).
- The application cannot accept American Express cards.
- You must use GitHub Copilot to help you build the application.
- You must instrument your application with New Relic using the Browser Monitoring Guided Install and the Node.js Guided Install.

## Run the application
`npm run start`

## Stop the application
Press `Ctrl` + `C`

## Bonus tasks
- Throughout the challenge, [Rita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rita-hill/) will appear with bonus tasks for the challenge. These are not required to complete the challenge, but we encourage you to give them a try.

## Additional resources

## Bonus tasks
**13 June 2024** - Last year I went ot Bogot√†, Colombia for the first time and I learned about Rappi üõµ, a food delivery service app that brought all of the delicious Colombian food that I wanted to my apartment. I used Rappi because while I don't speak a lot of Spanish, I know my numbers very well, so giving them the code to confirm my identity was easy. I ordered empanadas almost everyday, and ate my empanadas with the best coffee I had in Colombia from Libertario.

For your first bonus task, I want you to add a restaurant to your application that sells coffee and empanadas!

** 26 June 2024** - Two years ago, I went to Mexico City, and on my first day in the city, I visited Cafebrer√≠a El P√©ndulo. It was the largest bookstore I had ever seen! My friend, who was Mexican, showed me many books by different Spanish speaking poets that she loved. We spent an hour looking at the books before having lunch on the top floor.

For your next bonus task, I want you to create your own Cafebrer√≠a, and name each food item on the menu after a book from a Spanish speaking writer.
